<h2>Spike Defusal</h2></div>
Plant/Defuse-based game modes are the core of Valorant. These modes vary in stakes and style, but all of them have some things in common. These games are played in rounds of Attackers vs Defenders, where your team is randomly given a side prior to the match starting. After a certain number of rounds, the teams swap sides.<br><br>
In any given round, your goal as an Attacker is to help plant the Spike on one of the several bomb sites throughout the map. If you and your team successfully defend the planted Spike, it detonates and you win that round. Your job as a Defender is to either defuse the planted Spike before it explodes or prevent it from being planted before the round time limit ends. Alternatively, given that you have one life per round, you can simply kill the entire other team to win that round.<br><br>
<div id = "Unrated">
<h3>Unrated:</h3>
Unrated is Valorant’s standard game mode which includes all of the game’s main features. Agent select (unique agent per player per team), buy phase (with the standard economy system), and standard gameplay are all involved. There are 12 rounds per half, and first to 13 rounds wins. Should the score tie 12-12, overtimes of 1 round per half can be played until 2 rounds are won in a row. <br><br>
</div>
<div id = "Competitive">
<h3>Competitive:</h3>
Competitive is arguably the main focus of Valorant. It has the same ruleset as Unrated but with higher stakes. Your personal performance, wins, and losses contribute to your rank rating.<br><br>
  </div>
<div id = "SpikeRush">  
<h3>Spike Rush:</h3>
Spike Rush is meant to be a quick, bite-sized version of the Valorant experience. Agent select is still present, but buying is not. There are only 3 rounds per half where 4 rounds are required to win, and overtime is a single round. In this game mode, rounds are shorter and all players are given the same random loadout with all non-ultimate abilities immediately available. Certain orbs are placed across the map which provide you with various buffs to influence the round.<br><br>
    </div>
<div id = "Replication">  
<h3>Replication:</h3>
Replication is a casual game mode where everyone on a team plays as the same agent. There are 4 rounds in a half, first to 5 wins, and overtime is one round. Each new round refreshes your abilities and resets your weapons and shields. Regardless of round outcome, everyone receives 900 Creds on round 1, 2,400 on round 2, 3,900 on round 3, and 6,000 on round 4.<br><br>
</div>
<div id = "deathmatch">
  <h2>Deathmatch</h2></div>
In Deathmatch-style game modes, your primary goal is to kill enemies continuously where respawning is allowed.<br><br>
<div id = "Deathmatch">  
<h3>Deathmatch</h3>
Deathmatch is a 12-player free-for-all on a random map. This is typically played as a “warm up” prior to an actual match, where you ensure your gunplay skills are on point before putting it to the test in an official match. This mode is used solely for shooting practice — agents and abilities are not relevant, Heavy Shields are automatically given, and all weapons are available. The match ends after a player reaches 40 kills or after 9 minutes passes.<br><br>
    </div>
<div id = "Escalation">  
<h3>Escalation</h3>
Escalation is a casual 5v5 team deathmatch that features a random assortment of unconventional weapons. Each team receives a random “escalation tool” to start with that range from snowball launchers to paint shells. Getting enough kills as a team advances your team’s level up one — the team that finishes 12 levels wins.<br><br>
  </div>
    
<div id = "SnowballFight">  
<h3>Snowball Fight</h3>
Snowball Fight is a 5v5 team deathmatch where everyone uses snowball launchers to kill the enemy team. Random power ups can be acquired that buff the effectiveness of the launcher or buff your movement. The first team to 50 kills wins.<br><br>
