    In this game, players control characters that are called agents. Each agent has four abilities including an ultimate. Currently, there are 20 agents in the game namely: <small>(in alphabetical order)</small>

          <li><img src = https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/blt5599d0d810824279/6036ca30ce4a0d12c3ec1dfa/V_AGENTS_587x900_Astra.png alt = "Image of gent Astra" width = "100"><br>
Astra - Astra debuted as one of the most unique agents in Valorant due to her abilities that you can place anywhere on the map.
            <br>
She’s a controller that can play the game like a chess match, being able to set her team up with smokes, stuns, and blackholes.<br><br>
Nebula (E) – Uses stars placed in Astral Form (X). Can trigger stars to become a nebula, which acts like a smoke screen.<br>
Gravity Well (C) – Uses stars placed in Astral Form (X). Can trigger stars to form gravity wells which sucks all players towards the centre and then explodes. Anyone caught in the blast radius is made vulnerable.<br>
Nova Pulse (Q) – Uses stars placed in Astral Form (X). Can trigger stars to unleash a concussive explosion after a short timer.<br>
Astral Form / Cosmic Divide (X) – Activate to enter a ghost-like state where you have a birds-eye view of the battlefield map. This is where you place stars to fuel your other abilities. Stars can instead be dissipated to be placed again later – when you do this, a temporary Nebula effect is triggered.<br><br><br>
</li>
          <li><img src = https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/blt100d13bfa8286a3d/5eb7cdc11ea0c32e33b95fa2/V_AGENTS_587x900_Breach.png alt = "Image of agent Breach" width = "100"><br>Breach - Breach is designed to be an initiator who excels at playing through walls and opponents that are positioned to hold chokepoints.<br>
His mechanics go through terrain and across the map to CC and kill enemies.<br><br>
Fault Line (E) – Equip a seismic blast, hold fire to increase the distance, and release to set off a quake that dazes all players caught in it.<br>
Aftershock (C) – Equip a Fusion Charge and fire it to send a slow-firing burst through a wall, which deals high damage to anyone it connects with. More handy for clearing corners than actually getting frags.<br>
Flashpoint (Q) – Equip a blinding charge that can be set on a wall. It fires a fast burst that blinds anyone on the other side.<br>
Rolling Thunder (X) – Equip a seismic charge, fire to send a quake through all terrain in the ult’s cone of effect. This dazes and knocks anyone caught in its blast into the air. It also deals some damage.<br><br>
</li>

His Rendezvous (teleport) ability allows him to peek risky angles and find opening picks for his team, much of the time if he teleports in a timely manner he can escape unpunished.

Nightfall (X) – The power of Fear. Send out a wave of nightmare energy, which even goes through walls. The energy reveals opponents as well as deafening and decaying them.<br><br></li>
          <li><img src = https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/blt81e8a3e8c7beeaf3/634894a15e281916980f655b/Harbor_KeyArt-web.png alt = "Image of agent Harbor" width = "100"><br>Harbor - The newest released agent and obtains a controller role. CONTROLLER
<br>

<br>
She doesn’t provide much utility outside of a smoke grenade but she can dash to engage/disengage or get up to high positions with her boost jump.
          <br><br>
Tailwind (E) – Dash a short distance.<br>
Cloudburst (C) – Throw a cloud of fog that obscures vision on impact.<br>
Updraft (Q) – Launch upwards after a brief delay.<br>

          <li><img src = https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/blte5aefeb26bee12c8/60ca5aa30ece0255888d7faa/KAYO_KeyArt_587x900.png alt = "Image of agent Kay/O" width = "100"><br>Kay/O - KAY/O is a valuable asset to any team due to his “Suppression” capabilities that prevent enemy agents from using their abilities
<br>
In addition he’s very versatile with a flash and molly, as well as a potent engage ultimate that allows his teammates to resurrect him after he dies for a short amount of time.
          <br><br>
Zero/Point (E) – Equips a throwable knife that will stick to the first surface it hits and explode after a short timer. Anyone within the blast radius will be suppressed.<br>
Frag/Ment (C) – Equips a throwable grenade that will stick to the floor, unleashing multiple explosions. Damage dealt depends on proximity to the ventre, where the damage dealt is near-lethal.<br><br>
Flash/Drive (Q) – Equips a throwable flash grenade. Anyone caught in the blast radius is blinded.<br>
Null/CMD (X) – Buffs Kayo with increased rate of fire and reload speed, and this ability also emits a pulse that will suppress any enemies within the area of effect.<br><br></li>
          <li><img src = https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/blt53405c26141beff8/5f21fda671ec397ef9bf0894/V_AGENTS_587x900_KillJoy_.png alt = "Image of agent Killjoy" width = "100"><br>Killjoy - Killjoy is a German genius who uses an arsenal of turrets, mines, and traps.

Additionally, her slide allows her to engage in a manner that makes her very hard to track and gun down.
<br>
Unlike other duelists who are pretty self-sufficient when it comes to fragging, Neon’s all in type playstyle works a bit better when there is synergy with Initiator and Controller utility.
          <br><br>
High Gear (E) – Gives Neon an instant speed boost. When charged, you can also pull off an electric slide move that resets every two kills.<br>
Fast Lane (C) – Fire two walls of energy either side of you that extend until they reach the limit or hit a hard surface. These walls block vision and will damage any enemy that passes through them.<br>
Relay Bolt (Q) – Throws an energy bolt that will bounce a single time. Once it’s hit two hard surfaces the ground beneath both points will be electrified and cause concussion.<br>
Overdrive (X) – Unleashes Neon’s full power for a speed boost, but the power can be channelled instead into a deadly lightning attack. Every kill you get with this resets the duration timer.<br><br></li>
          <li><img src = https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/blt4e5af408cc7a87b5/5eb7cdc17bedc8627eff8deb/V_AGENTS_587x900_Omen.png alt = "Image of agent Omen" width = "100"><br><br>Omen - 
          Omen is a flanker who is able to get behind enemy lines with teleports and strike from sneaky angles.
<br>
He has some utility in the form of a smoke grenade and another ability that can go through walls and obscure the vision of enemies.
          <br><br>
Dark Cover (E) – Cast an orb that bursts into a sphere of shadow obscuring the final location. Can be charged to increase distance.<br>
Shrouded Step (C) – After a delay, teleport a short distance.<br>
Paranoia (Q) – Cast a shadow in a straight line that blinds anyone it touches.<br>
From the Shadows (X) – Select anywhere on the map to teleport and reform, will initially appear as a shadow, which can be killed by enemies and cancel the teleport. If teleport is successful, you become invisible for a short time.<br><br></li>
          <li><img src = https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/bltf0200e1821b5b39f/5eb7cdc144bf8261a04d87f9/V_AGENTS_587x900_Phx.png alt = "Image of agent Phoenix" width = "100"><br>Phoenix - 
          Phoenix is a pyromancer with an explosive playstyle, utilizing fire to control the flow of battle. He can use them to create walls, as flashbangs around corners, and of course, as an AoE molotov.
<br>
Naturally, he has an ultimate that suits his name as he can activate it, fight and die, and then come back to life where he originally activated it.
          <br><br>
Hot Hands (E) – Throw a fireball that explodes after a short delay on impact with the ground. The fire zone damages enemies but heals Phoenix.<br>
Blaze (C) – Cast a flame wall that blocks enemy vision and damages anyone passing through it. The wall can be bent both horizontally and vertically so you can cover ramps, too.<br>
Curveball (Q) – Cast a curved flare that bursts into a light after a short delay, temporarily blinding anyone and can be curved left and right.<br>
Run it Back (X) – Marks your current location. If you die while this ability is active, or when it expires, you’ll respawn at the marked location with full health.<br><br></li>
          <li><img src = https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/blt6fef56a8182d0a81/5ebf2c2798f79d6925dbd6b4/V_AGENTS_587x900_ALL_Raze_2.png alt = "Image of agent Raze" width = "100"><br>Raze - Raze is the de facto explosives expert of Valorant with some of the most kill potential in the game.

          <br><br>
Paint Shells (E) – Cluster grenade that deals initial impact damage, followed by damage from the clusters.<br>
Boom Bot (C) – Set down an explosive robot that goes in a straight line, bouncing off walls until it detects an enemy in front of it. It will then home in and detonate on them unless shot.<br>
Blast Pack (Q) – Like a C4 satchel. Throw it down and either detonate it when you want or let the timer run down. Deals AoE damage and displaces Agents.<br>
Showstopper (X) – Pull out a rocket launcher and fire it down a lane. The explosion deals huge damage to anyone in its radius. We’ve seen aces with a single shot from this.<br><br></li>
          <li><img src = https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/blt6577b1f58530e6b2/5eb7cdc121a5027d77420208/V_AGENTS_587x900_Reyna.png alt = "Image of agent Reyna" width = "100"><br>Reyna - Reyna is a vampire whose abilities are fueled by kills.<br>

What she lacks in utility is made up for by her raw killing power.<br>
She can inflict Nearsight on her enemies, heal herself, turn intangible, and even turn invisible.
As a result, she’s one of the best duelists and skirmishers in the game.<br><br>
          
Dismiss (E) – Consumes a nearby soul orb, becoming intangible for a short duration. If your ultimate is active, also become invisible.<br>
Leer (C) – Throw an eye through surfaces. The eye will blind all enemies who look at – only affects distant vision, so use to take on AWPers.<br>
Devour (Q) – Enemies killed by Reyna leave behind Soul Orbs that last 3 seconds. Consume a nearby soul orb, rapidly healing for a short duration. Health gained through this skill exceeding 100 will decay over time. If your ultimate is active, this skill will automatically cast and not consume the orb.<br>
Empress (X) – Enter a frenzy, increasing firing speed, equip, and reload speed dramatically. Scoring a kill renews the duration.<br><br></li>
          <li><img src = https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/blt8a627ec10b57f4f2/5eb7cdc16509f3370a5a93b7/V_AGENTS_587x900_sage.png alt = "Image of agent Sage" width = "100"><br>Sage - Sage is currently the only “healer” in Valorant with a defensively-oriented kit, with a healing orb she can use on herself or an ally.
<br>
She’s able to use ice abilities to slow and block off her enemies (her ice wall can also be used to boost allies to high ground).
<br>
She has one of the most powerful ultimates in the game with a resurrection.
          <br><br>
Healing Orb (E) – Heal an ally or yourself to full health over a few seconds.<br>
Barrier Orb (C) – A wall that can be rotated.<br>
Slow Orb (Q) – An orb that breaks into a slowing field on impact with the found, all caught in the field are slowed, grounded, and make a noise when moving.<br>
Resurrection (X) – Target a friendly corpse, after a short delay revive them with full health.<br><br></li>
          <li><img src = https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/blt302fcb2b9628c376/5f7fa6ff8db9ea0f149ece0a/V_AGENTS_587x900_ALL_Skye.png alt = "Image of agent Brimstone" width = "100"><br>Skye - An initiator who can provide a lot of information to her team through her animals. Her dog can clear out spaces and concuss opponents if found; it functions similarly to Sova’s Owl Drone when it comes to clearing space.
<br>
Her flashes can be set off very quickly and this makes them hard to dodge consistently even at high elo. Not only this but her flash alongside her Seekers are great information gathering abilities.
<br>
She’s an Initiator + Support hybrid that can help her team by engaging, scouting, and healing.
          <br><br>
Guiding Light (E) – You equip a hawk trinket and fire it out, keeping the trigger held down to guide it to where your crosshair is sitting. Can be triggered again to cause the hawk to explode in a blinding flash.<br>
Regrowth (C) – You equip a healing trinket to heal any allies in range and line-of-sight. Skye cannot heal herself, but you can keep using this ability until the ability pool is depleted. Note that the pool depletes at the same rate regardless of how many allies you’re healing.<br>
Trailblazer (Q) – Use a trinket to summon a Tasmanian Tiger which you take direct control of. Pressing the ‘fire’ button will cause it to leap forward and explode in a concussive blast that will damage directly hit enemies.<br>
Seekers (X) – Fire out three seekers, which will track down the three nearest enemies. If one manages to reach its target, it will give them the ‘nearsighted’ debuff.<br><br></li>
          <li><img src = https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/bltf11234f4775729b7/5ebf2c275e73766852c8d5d4/V_AGENTS_587x900_ALL_Sova_2.png alt = "Image of agent Sova" width = "100"><br>Sova - Sova is a master archer who is able to bounce his arrows to scout enemies or kill them around corners. He also has a handy owl drown that can be used to mark where an enemy is.
<br>
He can use his ability to track his opponents in combination with his ultimate, which allows him to fire three bursts of lightning through walls.
          <br><br>
Recon Bolt (E) – Fire a bolt that deploys a sonar emitter and tags nearby enemies, revealing them.<br>
Owl Drone (C) – Deploy and control a drone that reveals enemies around the map. Once active you can fire a tracking dart that reveals one enemy’s location until they remove it.<br>
Shock Bolt (Q) – Fire and explosive bolt that damages enemies on impact. Use it to clear out boxes and corners.<br>
Hunter’s Fury (X) – Fire up to three energy blasts that spear across the entire map and each hit enemy takes damages and is marked.<br><br></li>
          <li><img src = https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/bltc825c6589eda7717/5eb7cdc6ee88132a6f6cfc25/V_AGENTS_587x900_Viper.png alt = "Image of agent Viper" width = "100"><br>Viper - Viper wields toxic gases that run off of a refillable reserve. She can emit poison from a grenade or create a line wall with the vapors.<br>

Her ultimate basically creates a poison “room”, making her a great bomb planter.<br><br>
          
Toxic Screen (E) – Deploy a line of gas that can be reactivated to create a wall of toxic gas which costs fuel.<br>
Snakebite (C) – Fire a projectile that explodes into a pool of acid that does damage.<br>
Poison Cloud (Q) – Throw a cloud of gas that can be reactivated to create a smoke cloud which costs fuel. This can be redeployed after a cooldown.<br>
Viper’s Pit (X) – A toxic cloud covers a large radius and highlights enemies to Viper, the duration of the cloud extends if Viper remains in the cloud.<br><br></li>
          <li><img src = https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb6530b271fddd0b1/bltd4080f8efb365751/5ff5660bb47cdf7fc7d6c3dc/V_AGENTS_587x900_yoru.png alt = "Image of agent Yoru" width = "100"><br>Yoru - Yoru is a tricky duelist that is built to lurk, acting as the worst nightmare to potential flankers. His kit allows him to deceive enemies and bait out utility by faking site executions on the attacker side.<br>

Yoru is soon to receive a rework since he has been underperforming in both ranked and pro play. There has been a lot of speculation around his new abilities being very strong.<br><br>
          
Gatecrash (E) – Equip and fire a rift tether that will move in a straight line, diverting only when it encounters an obstacle like a wall. You can anchor a tether in place with the alt-fire button, and then activate to instantly teleport to that tether’s location.<br>
Fakeout (C) – You can place up to two echoes that will mimic the sound of footsteps. You can also make them move about a bit similar to Gatecrash’s rift tether.<br>
Blindside (Q) – Take a fragment of reality and throw it. When it hits a hard surface it will bounce but also charge up a flash which will detonate not long after. Combos well with Gatecrash.<br>
Dimensional Drift (X) – Equip a mask that can see between dimensions and also lets you enter a personal dimension where you can’t be touched, but also can’t affect the world around you until you remerge. Basically like invisibility.<br></li>
